#The Continued Adventures of Horgonomous Borgooeybackey
##Chapter 1, The Re-beginning

It had been a while since Horgonomous had been adventuring. Actually it had been some time since he had done anything at all. It appeared those 10 years has passed without notice. His memory was blank as if someone or something had simply willed him back into existence.

Regardless of this conundrum, Horgonomous decided he would get up and do something, anything to keep him busy. Looking around he saw a sea of beer cans and bourbon bottles and decided he must have been partying hard. Thinking comically about parting the mess with Moses like powers Horgonomous picked his tired body up off the sofa he was sleeping on and started wading over to the door of his messy flat.

Opening the door he squinted at the bright light pouring through. He figured temporary blindness must be from partying in the dark recesses of his flat for so long; although there was still no recollection of any of that. Horgonomous stood there squinting hard out the door but no images of outside were forming. In fact now he realized that there was nothing out there but whiteness. Holding onto the door frame he hung his foot out the door and like he was testing the temperature of the pool water he dipped his foot into the nothingness. Surprisingly enough there was nothing. Carefully lifting himself back into the doorway, he stepped back into the flat he bent over and picked up a Southern Draft can and held it out the door into the oblivion. With a confused look on his face Horgonomous dropped the can and watched it flip end over end as it plummeted downward. Getting smaller and smaller until the speck was too small to see.

Thinking this quite peculiar he, waded across to the fridge and attempted to grab a cold one to steady his nerves.

“More bloody white!” He cursed in a croaky voice that hadn’t been used for ten years or so.
Waves of cans and bottles swished around as Horgonomous paced back and forward across in front of the fridge which was now shining out whiteness into the dark confines of the flat. ‘No beer!’ What was he going to do now? Nowhere to go, no beer to drink?

Then a thought, ‘The phone!’. Horgonomous swam across to the phone which was sitting the small stand which was protruding out of the ocean of clutter. He grabbed the hand set and held it up in front of his face.
“I can’t remember a bloody thing.”

He pushed redial and waited. Beep – beep – beep – beep – beep – beep – beep – beep – beep – beep – beep – beep – beep. As the redial performed it’s task. ‘Obviously an international number’, but things weren’t surprising Horgonomous much by now. Things certainly were shaping up to be a strange morning.

The Dial tone repeated through the earpiece.

After the oddity of this mornings antics had settled a little in Horgos' mind  he decided that the happenings were a sign and that, given the lack of beer and outdoor entertainment, he was supposed to clean his flat.

After putting on his somewhat stained and sweaty overalls and a free "swine flu" face mask he had left over from a recent visit to the doctors, he began to clean. Starting in the living room Horgo tossed can after can into a massive black sack in the corner that he'd prepared earlier forseeing that his flat would most likey get in the state that is was, given his love for beer and hate for standing up.

As he cleaned Horgo came upon many items that he'd fogotton he had. Most interesting of which were the replica Austin Powers sweedish made penis enlarger pump, his favourite book "Green eggs and ham" from a time when he used to read and a now oddly deformed broken Rubics cube. Oddly enough the book Green Eggs and Ham only contained 50 unique words, Horgo deemed this a work of genuis and made special effort to ensure that he did everything in life with only the minimal effort required to get by. He pumped the penis enlarger a few times and laughed before tossing it (no double entendre intended) into his black sack and pocketed the deformed Rubics cube to look at at a later date as he was sure that, although the cube was previously broken, it wasn't deformed and that it could be connected in a strange way to the other odd things that had happend to him this morning.

Pleased with his recent bounty Horgo continued to clean whist chanting the manta "I do not like green eggs and ham I do not like them sam I am". Anyone looking in would have thought this peculiar man was performing some kind of strange ritual. Unfotunately for Horgo the only thing looking in from the whiteness was far far stranger than him.
