# The Re-beginning

It had been a while since Horgonomous had been adventuring. Actually it had been some time since he had done anything at all. It appeared those 10 years has passed without notice. His memory was blank as if someone or something had simply willed him back into existence.

Regardless of this conundrum, Horgonomous decided he would get up and do something, anything to keep him busy. Looking around he saw a sea of beer cans and bourbon bottles and decided he must have been partying hard. Thinking comically about parting the mess with Moses like powers Horgonomous picked his tired body up off the sofa he was sleeping on and started wading over to the door of his messy flat.

Opening the door he squinted at the bright light pouring through. He figured temporary blindness must be from partying in the dark recesses of his flat for so long; although there was still no recollection of any of that. Horgonomous stood there squinting hard out the door but no images of outside were forming. In fact now he realized that there was nothing out there but whiteness. Holding onto the door frame he hung his foot out the door and like he was testing the temperature of the pool water he dipped his foot into the nothingness. Surprisingly enough there was nothing. Carefully lifting himself back into the doorway, he stepped back into the flat he bent over and picked up a Southern Draft can and held it out the door into the oblivion. With a confused look on his face Horgonomous dropped the can and watched it flip end over end as it plummeted downward. Getting smaller and smaller until the speck was too small to see.

Thinking this quite peculiar he, waded across to the fridge and attempted to grab a cold one to steady his nerves.

“More bloody white!” He cursed in a croaky voice that hadn’t been used for ten years or so. Waves of cans and bottles swished around as Horgonomous paced back and forward across in front of the fridge which was now shining out whiteness into the dark confines of the flat. ‘No beer!’ What was he going to do now? Nowhere to go, no beer to drink?

Then a thought, ‘The phone!’. Horgonomous swam across to the phone which was sitting the small stand which was protruding out of the ocean of clutter. He grabbed the hand set and held it up in front of his face. “I can’t remember a bloody thing.”

He pushed redial and waited. Beep – beep – beep – beep – beep – beep – beep – beep – beep – beep – beep – beep – beep. As the redial performed it’s task. ‘Obviously an international number’, but things weren’t surprising Horgonomous much by now. Things certainly were shaping up to be a strange morning.

The Dial tone repeated through the earpiece.

After the oddity of this mornings antics had settled a little in Horgos' mind he decided that the happenings were a sign and that, given the lack of beer and outdoor entertainment, he was supposed to clean his flat.

After putting on his somewhat stained and sweaty overalls and a free "swine flu" face mask he had left over from a recent visit to the doctors, he began to clean. Starting in the living room Horgo tossed can after can into a massive black sack in the corner that he'd prepared earlier forseeing that his flat would most likey get in the state that is was, given his love for beer and hate for standing up.

As he cleaned Horgo came upon many items that he'd fogotton he had. Most interesting of which were the replica Austin Powers sweedish made penis enlarger pump, his favourite book "Green eggs and ham" from a time when he used to read and a now oddly deformed broken Rubics cube. Oddly enough the book Green Eggs and Ham only contained 50 unique words, Horgo deemed this a work of genuis and made special effort to ensure that he did everything in life with only the minimal effort required to get by. He pumped the penis enlarger a few times and laughed before tossing it \(no double entendre intended\) into his black sack and pocketed the deformed Rubics cube to look at at a later date as he was sure that, although the cube was previously broken, it wasn't deformed and that it could be connected in a strange way to the other odd things that had happend to him this morning.

Pleased with his recent bounty Horgo continued to clean whist chanting the manta "I do not like green eggs and ham I do not like them sam I am". Anyone looking in would have thought this peculiar man was performing some kind of strange ritual. Unfotunately for Horgo the only thing looking in from the whiteness was far far stranger than him.

Horgonomous breathed out with a satified huff and looked over his hard work. The large plastic bag had somehow managed to contain the entire mess which had previously been distributed around his flat. He had found an interesting mix of objects hiding in the mess. The vacuum cleaner had been one of these items. It was just an ordinary cheap vacuum cleaner, but what had been done to it was a little disturbing. It must have been dismanteled during the partying. He found it under a half of a ironing board that had been broken clean in half. The motor had been brutally ripped from it, the aftermath looking like open heart surgury on an unfortunate robot. There had seemed to be a superfluous number of vacuum cleaner parts strewn around the and Horgo had wondered how they could all possibly fit back in. Regardless they all went into the cavernous black rubbish bag.

The rest of the room was tidy now, but not clean, and hourgonomous lamented the brutal murder of his vacuum cleaner. The rubbish bag bulged in the corner, dominating the room with its bulk and almost touching the ceiling. Although it was static, Horgo mused that it was creaking and swaying like the winner of a hotdog eating contest.

Now that the room was clear of the debris, the white light blasting in from the open front door and from the open fridge appeared more disturbing than before, maybe the theraputic clean had cleared some of the brain fuzz he woke up with.  
"Hmmmm" Horgo walked back over to the open door, squinting again from the overpowering light. There was no horrizon, no up, no down. "This space needs filling up" he said to the void. There was no echo. It was kind of like talking in fog or a snowfall, where the sound is always muted. "It needs to go somewhere I guess", Horgo turned and paced unhindered to the corner and grabbed the taught belly of the rubbish bag and pulled. It was heavy, but now that the floor was completely clear it would slide accross ok with some effort.

Horgonomous tugged on the bag. It moved an inch. He tugged again, with a grunt. It moved another inch. Grunt - grunt - grunt - grunt - grunt. This contunied for a few minutes, half way through Horgo slowed down as he came close to laughter, when he pictued what his squat dance with the rubbish bag must look like. He named this dance the 'Angry Ape', then fell into character for the remainder of the haul.

Finally he came to the open door and decided that he should swap sides and push rather than pull, to avoid joining the bag in the oblivion.

With the huge bag pressed up against the doorway. Horgonomous gave a mighty push. The bag bulged at the sides but only a small bumped was sticking through, seeing as the bag was three times the width of the door, it was not suprising. Horgo's resolve to expell the bag now evaporated and with a huff he turned and surveyed the dimly lit room. Now that the abyss was blocked from view he felt better. He thought to himself that the bag of rubbish can stay there for now.

There was the matter of the fridge. It had also proven to be full of nothing. He strolled over to the fridge with hands in pockets to survey the shaft of white light shining out of the fridge onto the wall accross the room. Horgo approached and gently extended his arm through the fridge opening. The nature of the air seem no different to the air in the flat. He ran his hand around the sides of the opening. The nothingness seemed to start just inside the open fridge. His hand reached around further along where the internal wall should have been and felt the wall loop back around towards him. To his amazement what he felt and what he saw were two different things. His hand reached right around the left side and felt the opening of the fridge again, but he did not see his hand come out of the side of the fridge and around to the front.

Horgonomous had to see this. He lay down on the floor on his side, held onto one side of the fridge then wiggled himself forward into the opening and attempted to curl himself around the entry to see where the rest of the fridge wall dissapeared to. The standalone fridge was raised off the floor with castors and the edge of the fridge dug into his ribs as he lay half in the fridge into the empty space. He managed to crane his head and neck back around the corner to see nothing but an entrance to the fridge again. From this unconfotable angle all there was just a an opening to a fridge floating in the nothingness of enpty white. But to Horgo's delight the interior of the fridge was finite. And half full of beers.

"Yesss!" Horgo release one of his hands and pumped his fist in the air. The over enthusiastic pump slid his body out further into the void, Horgo gasped and split his legs to prevent himself falling further and hung upside down into th void, the blood collecting in his face turning it red. "While I'm hanging here in the void I might as well get myself a drink" he thought to himself. Both hand were free now and his legs were wrapped backwards onto the entrance of the fridge while the rest of him hung upside down, his face going red. He grasped the new lower cill of fridge number two and curled his body round and grabbed a cold one which happened to be attached to 3 other beers by the looped plastic around the tops. Horgo slowly returned to the bat like hang and tried to place the beers on to the flat floor. He was hanging too far out and could not reach without throwing them. But the likelyhood of throwing them back behind him and into the flat was not very good. So Horgo took the plastic binding of the beers in his teeth and prepared for an awkward climb back to safety. He ran his hand back up his lg until his fingers grasped the edge of the fridge wall and started wiggling side to side aided by his handhold managed to inch back into the flat.

Horgonomous scrambled accross to the opposite wall and slouched down against it facing the open fridge. As he freed a beer from its loop he mused about the location of the other beers. The fridge, at first glance, appeared to be missing its insides, but the contents and cavity of teh fridge were actually in the exact position they were supposed to be in, only Horgo had to look back on that position via the void to actually find it. "This is far too complicated for me." Horgo announced aloud and cracked open his beer.

"Aarrhh!, you've got to be!.., stupid piece of .. Rrrghh!" Horgonomous cursed. he was squinting down into his can of beer as another shaft of light shone back at him from the newly cracked opening.
